## Version 2
We are in the exploration / pre-alpha stage of GSv2 - check back later...

## Developer Setup
Clone the repository, install dependencies and tell webpack to compile the project and start watching for changes (this can take a while):
```
git clone https://github.com/glyphr-studio/Glyphr-Studio-2.git && cd Glyphr-Studio-2 && npm install && bower install && npm run compile-commons && webpack -w
```

When developing, make sure `webpack -w` is running.
